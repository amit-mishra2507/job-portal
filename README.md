# **JobZee - Job Portal**

JobZee is a full-stack web application that allows job seekers to explore job listings and apply for them, while enabling recruiters to post job opportunities and track applications. The platform is designed to streamline the hiring process by offering easy-to-use interfaces for both job seekers and recruiters.

The application uses **ReactJS** on the frontend and **Node.js/Express** on the backend, with **MongoDB** as the database. It incorporates secure authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Token)** and password hashing using **bcrypt.js** to protect user data.

Key features of the application include:

- **User Authentication**: Supports registration and login for both job seekers and recruiters.
- **Job Posting and Management**: Allows recruiters to create job postings, manage them, and track applications.
- **Job Search and Filtering**: Provides job seekers with the ability to search and filter jobs based on various criteria.
- **Application Tracking**: Job seekers can track the jobs they have applied for, while recruiters can manage applicants for their job postings.
- **Profile Management**: Users can manage their profiles, including viewing their applied jobs or posted jobs.

This project leverages **Vite.js** for efficient development, and integrates with **Cloudinary** for handling image uploads.

Feel free to clone the repository and explore the features.
